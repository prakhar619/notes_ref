IAM: Identity and Access Management
    Manage user/people as well as apis
    and their authority

Authentication vs Authorisation
    Authentication: You say who you are.
        Email and Password
        Access key id and secret access key
        User id and Password 

    Authorisation: Are you authorised to do this 

Root User
    Dont create/enable access key pair
    Dont use email-password for normal usage; create admin for it.
    Always use MFA

Multi Factor Authentication 
    Virtual MFA
        Phone app 
        Not as secure as others
    Hardware
        Key Fob
        Display Card Device
        Shows code to enter on device
    U2F
        Hardware device to plug into USB

IAM
Global and not region specific (which is unlike services)
Supports Identity Federation (where corporate network or internet identity provider directly integrates to create multiple user and psd)

    Types of Ids
        IAM Users
        IAM Groups
        IAM Roles

        IAM Policy
        

IAM Policy
    Json Based Document
        {
            "Version" : "2017-10-17",
            "Statement" : [{
                "Effect" : "Allow",
                "Action" : "*",
                "Resource" : "*"
        }]
        }
    4 Major Parts 
        Version 
            which version of IAM policy will be use
        Effect  
            whether to allow or disable the specified action
        Action  
            which APIs/Service we are refering
        Resource  
            the scope of the action/ objects that will be affected

IAM Role 
    Either an Service needs IAM role to access other APIs calls (like EC2 instance needs S3 access)
    or an user may need it when using identity provider system (like creating instant user ids using federated system for many users)
    
IAM Identity centre 
    AWS Service for Enhancing IAM experience.
    Easily integrates with Federated IdP.

By Default all users are implicitly denied any request except root which has just the opposite.
Explict allow is required.
A permission boundary such as Amazon Organization SCP or session policy may implicitly deny user of request.
