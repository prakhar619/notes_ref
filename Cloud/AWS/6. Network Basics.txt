Network not so important for Serverless (lambda)

IP Address
    IPv4
    IPv6

Collections of IP Address
    CIDR Notation
        192.168.1.30/24 : Out of All the 32 bits, starting 24 bits are fixed.
        Therefore usable: 192.168.1.1, 192.168.1.2, ..., 192.168.1.255, 192.168.2.255, ...


VPC
    Virtual Private Cloud -> Set CIDR IP Range 
    Specific to Region
    DNS resolution enabled DNS hostnames enabled, allowing instances within the VPC to receive DNS hostnames that correspond to their public IP addresses.

Subnet 
    Sub Network inside VPC which is present at one AZ only.
    Different AZ, different Subnet.
    Same AZ, multiple Subnet present.
    Requirement 
        VPC Selection 
        AZ Selection 
        CIDR  (should be subset of VPC CIDR) 
    5 address for Subset CIDR is reserved by AWS for functionality
    Can be set to private or public (using route table entry and association)

Example of VPC and Subnet CIDR 
    10.1.0.0/16
    10.1.1.0/24

Now we have AWS Cloud -> Region -> VPC -> AZ -> Subnet -> EC2 Instance

Now Internet Gateway/Private Gateway, Routing, 

Internet Gateway    
    Create and attach to VPC 

Private Gateway 
    VGW (Virtual Gateway) for connecting to another private network through VPN 

Routing 
    Public Subnet   
        Local
        Internet Gateway 

    Private
        Local 

    Destination:
        For public: 0.0.0.0/0
    Target:
        Next step for packet to ultimately reach destination 
        Eg. Internet Gateway, local

    Can be applied at VPC level or Subnet level
    Routing table need to associated with subset.
    Longest Prefix Match
    Arrange in order of Priority (cause if matched, wont go to next)
    Dual stacking is using IPv4 and IPv6 in routing tables.

Security 
    ACL level
    Security Groups

ACL 
    Access Control List
    Subnet level (Control traffic of a subnet)
    Stateless, meaning add both inbound and outbound traffic. 

Security Group 
    EC2 instance level 
    Not optional 
    Default: Block all inbound traffic and allow all outbound traffic 
    Stateful, meaning configure either inbound or outbound will work as they will temporary allow traffic on both side to respond to request. 


AWS VPN 
    2 Different Service 
        Site-Site VPN 
            Connecting Private Data centre to AWS 
        AWS Client VPN 
            Connecting Admins to AWS Service through VPN for managing services 
    
AWS Direct Connect 
    provides hosted private connection to AWS through a Direct Connect Delivery partner/AWS for higher bandwidth 
    Dedicated Connection 
    No use of Internet
