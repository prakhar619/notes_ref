Sample Application
    Application Backend Code on             EC2 (Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud)
    Textual Data on                         RDS (Amazon Relational Database Service)
    Image Data on                           S3 (Amazon Storage Service)
    Monitoring this project on              CloudWatch
    Managing Personal using                 IAM (Identity and Access Management)
    Managing Server Load using              Amazon Elastic Load Balancing
    Cacheing data for lower latency using   Amazon CloudFront

Benefits of Cloud Computing
    1. Pay as you Go 
    2. Massive economies of scale 
    3. Stop guessing capacity
    4. Increased speed and agility
    5. Stop spending money on running and maintaining data centres
    6. Go Global

*There is redundancy in a region, but not outside of a single region for safer storage.
    Meaning Data centres across a region may store same data for redundancy but not outside a region

Region Contains AZs which itself contain Data centres.

Choosing Region
1. Compliance
2. Latency
3. Pricies 
4. Service 
    Services majorly are provided on Region basics rather on account basis.

Available Regions
4 in US (east-2, west-2)
1 in Africa 
7 in Asia 
6 in Europe
1 in Middle east
1 in Canada
1 in South America

AWS Service Endpoints
    An endpoint is the URL of the entry point for an AWS web service.
    AWS CLI and SDKs automatically use default values within a region.
    All services are independent of each other in AWS meaning authorization, billing everything independent.
    Eg:
        https://dynamodb.us-west-2.amazonaws.com is the endpoint for the Amazon DynamoDB service in US west region 

    Global Endpoints do not support Regions.
        Amazon CloudFront
        AWS Global Accelerator
        AWS Identity and Access Management
        AWS Network Manager 
        AWS Organisations
        Amazon Route S3 
        AWS Shield Advanced 
        AWS WAF Classic 

FIPS Endpoint
