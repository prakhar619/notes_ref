Explaination
    EC2
        Contains Hypervisor and manages host machines and hypervisor layer
        Installs Guest OS on VM.

        Instance Types 
            On-Demand Instances 
                Compute as much as you need. Does not change dynamically. Manually on-demand
            Spot Instances
                When compute is below set threshold, you get the compute; Prone to losing compute when demand increase
            Reserved Instances
                1-3 year plan for compute instance.
            C7g Instances
            ....

            Trn1 Instances
                Contains GPU (ig); build for high performance deep learning training of GenAI

    Amazon EBS 
        Elastic Block Storage 
        EC2 + External Persistant Storage (like Hard-disk)
        Unlike Normal EC2 Where instance is either running or terminated; Can be in stopped state too
        Data is stored on Persistant Block which does not lose data on stopped state.
        Root Device is EBS volumn (unlike instance store volumn)

    EC2 Auto Scaling 
        Responds to demand.
        Create new instances according to your set requirement.
        Couples well with Load Balancer for IP Configuration of public ip 

    AWS Fargate
        Serverless for Container Service
        2 Mode 
            Fargate Launch type
            EC2 launch type

    AWS Lambda 
        General Purpose Serverless compute started by set triggers
        Charged only when used (efficient compute)


    AWS Image Builder
        Itself free
        Automate AMI building process
