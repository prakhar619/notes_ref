Storage vs Databases 

Storage is required by 
    OS 
    Software 
    System file
    Can be extended to media like 
        Images
        Database data like JSON or CSV 

2 Types of Storage 
    Block 
        Each file is split into multiple chucks
        Easy modify
    Object
        Each file, single unit of data 
        Rewrite whole if small section modify 

AWS Storage Service 
    File Storage
        Analogous to NAS         (Network Attached Storage)
        AWS EFS                  (Amazon Elastic File System)
        Hierarchical/Path System
    Block Storage 
        Analogous to DAS/SAN     (Direct Attached Storage) or (Storage Area Network)
        AWS EBS
        Instance Storage
    Object Storage
        AWS S3

Instance Storage vs EBS 
    Instance Storage is attached with EC2 and is terminated with EC2.
    EBS can be configured either to be terminated / not terminated with EC2.
    Instance Storage is faster. 
    IS contains OS.
    EBS Multi-Attach for Multiple EC2 to have same EBS.
    EBS is like external HDD, whereas IS is like internal HDD.

    Back up using SnapShot 
        Incremental Backup 


Object Storage with AWS S3
    EBS has size limitation.
    S3 can store variety of media (unstructured).
    Region -> Bucket -> Redundance across AZs.

    Create Bucket (like collection)
        Each bucket has an associated url
    Change Access in bucket details to Public Access.
    S3 Bucket Policy 
        JSON 
        Like IAM
        Policy apply to each object in that bucket

    Can Store:
        Media 
        Data Lake 
        static website 

    Encryption 
        Server-side 
        Client-side 

    Use Versioning to prevent data loss on overwrite. (when overwrite on same url/path of file)

    S3 Storage Class 
        Standard 
        S3 Intelligent-Tiering
        S3 Standard-Infrequent Access
