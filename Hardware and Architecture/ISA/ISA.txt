John Von Neumann
	Instructions are fetched from RAM
	
RICS vs CISC
RICS
	Reduced instruction set computer
	Offset the need to process more information by increasing speed of each instruction.
	Instruction Pipeline
	16 or 32
	MIPs architecture
	ARM architectures
	
CISC
	Complex Instructionn set computer
	cover the gap b/w RICS and high lvl lang and also encoding more dense instruction
	mainframe computers
	x86
	
Endianness
Little endian architecture vs big endian
	
	little
		least significant byte of word at biggest memory location
	big
		most significant byte of word at smallest memory location
