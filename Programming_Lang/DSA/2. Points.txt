XOR
1. 0 | 0 -> 0
2. 1 | 0 -> 1
3. 0 | 1 -> 1
4. 1 | 1 -> 0

5. 10 ^ 10 = 0
6. 1 ^ 2 = 3
7. 10 ^ 0 = 10

Division Constraint
1. x / y then y cannot be zero

Multiply Constraint
1. Overflow

Array Constraint
1. Index out of bounds

Time Complexity:
1. Consider carefully O(1) from O(n) as loops does not always mean O(n)
2. Try to increase loop (when needed) without increasing time complexity
