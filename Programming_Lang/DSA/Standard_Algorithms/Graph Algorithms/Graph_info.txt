A graph can be represented in multiple fashion.
	matrix (adjacency matrix)[File]
	list (adjacency list)[File]
	Diagram [RAM][Paper]
	any other non standard highly optimised way[File]

Graph Traversals:
	Diagram Model:
		BFS(Breath first search) [discover and explore]  Vertex Based Technique. Shortest path in graph. Queue data Structure. Slower than dfs. 
		DFS(Depth first search)  [discover and explore]  Edge Based Technique. Stack data structure. 
		

Graph is always associated with some standard functions.
