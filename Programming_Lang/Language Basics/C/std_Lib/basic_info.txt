Standard Functions of both C89 and C99.
C89 is subset of C99. C99 compiler provides backward compactibility

C compiler:
    translate souce -> object code
    standard lib must be implemented

Linkers
    Combines various pieces of code
    Resolve addresses of call and load

Separate Compilation
    Source code -compiler-> Object file -linker-> executable file
    external references, 





Library Files and Object Files
    Linking object files means entire content becomes part of finished executable.
    Linking library files means only that specific file (each file contains 1 specific function) becomes part of executable

Library 
    Header:
        2 jobs
            Contains function needed data types (each library uses new defined data types. Header stores it. No dependency on other library files)
                <stdio.h> contains FILE datatype
            Contains function prototype. (allows stronger type checking)

__ or _<CAP char> reserved name in C

LINK File1 File2 File3 LIBC
    linker first tries to solve dependencies using file1 file2 and file3 then using standard c library LIBC

    Redefining library function may have side effects on never be able to use that library Functions in all connected code
