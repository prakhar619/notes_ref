Compiled Language:
	Compiler and Linker  => Source Code -> Executable Program
	Source File = Translation Unit
	.c, .cc, .cxx, .cpp
	C++ Preprocessor => #include -> Add contents into the file prior its starting as if same file

	Translation Unit -compiler-> Object Code (.o) -Linker-> Executable 
	Object Code:
		Relocatable (addresses are not resolved)
		Unlinked (external References, global data outside the translation unit are not resolved)
	Executable:
		Final Relative address
		Linked (external Refs are fulfilled)

	Only during runtime absolute address are fulfilled (base address)

	Library
		Group of Object files
	DLL (Dynamic Link Library)
		Hybrid between regular static library and executable
		can act as executable
		some external ref might be unlinked (some are linked)
	
	Compiler Macros
		_MSC_VER (microsoft compiler) or __GNUC__ (GNU compiler)
	Target Macros
		__WIN32__ (Windows) or __linux__ (Linux)
	C++ Macro
		__cplusplus

	These are defined when used; #ifdef _DEBUG    #endif
