a = b (mod n)		asserts that a and b have same remainder when divided by n
a = kn + b
a-b is divisible by n

Basic Properties
	a = a mod n
	a = b mod n if b = a mod n
	a = b mod n and b = c mod n then a = c mod n
	
	a + k = b + k mod n
	ak = bk mod n
	
	a1 = b1 mod n	a2 = b2 mod n
		a1+a2 = b1+b2 mod n
		a1-a2 = b1-b2 mod n
		a1*a2 = b1*b2 mod n
	
	a^k = b^k mod n (non negative k)
	
	if c = d mod phi(n) then a^c = b^d mod n provided a is coprime with n	// phi(n) is ETF (eulers totient function)
	
	
	INVERSE
	Modular Multiplicative inverse
	a*a^-1 = 1 mod n
	
	if a = b mod n then a^-1 = b^-1 mod n
	
	To solve x = a^-1 mod n
		Bezout's Equation using extended euclidean algorithm
	
Advanced Properties
	
		Fermat's little Theorem
			a^(p-1) = 1 mod p  where p is prime and does not divide a
		Euler's Theorem
			a^(phi(n)) = 1 mod n where phi(n) is ETF; a and n are coprime
		
		Wilson's Theorem
			(p-1)! = -1 mod p
		Chinese remainder Theorem
