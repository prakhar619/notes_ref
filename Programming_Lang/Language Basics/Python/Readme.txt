Python Introduction
    Python 2.6 and 3.0
    General Purpose Programming Language
    Scripting Language (interpreted)
    Execution speed slower than c++/c
    Bytecode provides portability; platform independent Program 
    Python provides readable code
    dynamically typed; (keeps track of types instead of requiring declaration)
    Strongly Typed;    

Execution:
        source code -compiled-> bytecode(.pyc) -interpreter-> executable
        Byte code is a lower lvl platform independent code
        Byte code is executed by PVM (Python virtual machine); (part of python package)
        Byte code file extension (.pyc)


Applications:
    Web search System like google
    BitTorrent
    and many more...

2.6 -> 3.0 
    Discarded Features
    long  -> int 
    print x,y   -> print(x,y)
    and many more

Uses
    System Programming
        Posix binding in stl
    GUI
        tkinter
    Internet Scripting
    Database Programming
    Rapid Prototyping

Python Implementations:
    CPython
        Original and standard
        ANSI C language code
    Jython
        JPython 
        Java + Python
    IronPython
        .NET integration
        C#
    and secondary implementations like  
        Stackless Python


Strengths
    Procedural and OOPS
    Portable
    Automatic memory management
    Library utils
    3rd party utils
    Readable code


Future:
    PyPy project
    Unladen Swallow project
    Parrot project

Running Programs

FROZEN BINARY EXECUTABLES
    Package that combine your program byte code and python interpreter into a single executable program.
    Normally, freeze just before shipping.
