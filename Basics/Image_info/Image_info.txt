	Image metrics 
		pixel dimension
		resolution
		colorspace
		filesize



The metadata tags defined in the Exif standard cover a broad spectrum:

1.	Camera settings: This includes static information such as the camera model and make, and information that varies with each image such as orientation (rotation), aperture, shutter speed, focal length, metering mode, and ISO speed information.
	Other info

		File format
		Exposure Program
		Exposure Time
		Face INfo length
		face info offset
		face detected
		flash action
		flash level
		flash mode
		focal length
		focus mode
		full image size
		hdr setting
		hdr
		high noise iso reduction
		image stabilization
		intellignet auto
		jpeg qualitu
		lateral chromatic aberrration
		lens specs
		lens zoom position


2.	Image metrics: Pixel dimensions, resolution, colorspace, and filesize
3.	Date and time information. Digital cameras will record the current date and time and save this in the metadata.
4.	Location information
5.	A thumbnail for previewing the picture on the camera's LCD screen, in file managers, or in photo manipulation software.
6.	Descriptions
7.	Copyright information.



Software libraries, such as libexif[7] for C and Adobe XMP Toolkit[8] or Exiv2[9] for C++, Metadata Extractor[10] for Java, PIL/Pillow for Python, LEADTOOLS or ExifTool[11] for Perl, parse Exif data from files and read/write Exif tag values.
