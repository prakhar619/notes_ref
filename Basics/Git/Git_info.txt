Git

	DVCS
		Distributed Version Control
		Each user/collaborator has full history in local system.

	Snapshots based System
		Different from Delta Based Version Control where only changes are stored
		Kind of like storing file but not actually

	3 Stages
		Commited
		Staged
		Modified

	.git Repository
		All versions

	Working Dir
		Current version

	Transfer Protocols:
		https 	(https://)
		ssh	(git://) or (user@server:path)
		git

	Lifecycle of status of your files
		Untracked
			Files which are not being tracked (usually new file;)
			Files which are not present last snapshot and not in staging area
			directly switched to staged status after saving
		Unmodified
			File same as last snapshot;
			Commited Files
		Modified
			File which is already present in last snapshot but editted
		Staged
			New added file or Modified file staged; 

	Blobs
		version of file
		3 blobs (3 blob means 3 files)

	Git Repository Objects
		Commit List
			Commit node 
				Tree node 
					Blob 
					Blob 
					Blob 
		HEAD pointer

	Git merging	
		FastForward 
			No divergent working
			No new commit; just forwarding of branch
			Same line
			History of both is checked to see if fastforwarding is available
		3WayMerge 
			current branch is updated with new commit; branch_name doesn't changes
			common ancestor; both branches ptr 
			Different line 
			merge commit (A new commit is done)
			merge commit has more than one parent;

	Branching Workflows
		Long Running branches
		Topic branches	
		Remote branches	
			local ref; cant be moved
			Tracking Branches: automatically creates and edit remote branches
	
	Merging vs Rebase
		Rebase: in branch1 onto branch2 => branch2 + branch1' (where branch2->branch1') 		#branch1 is deleted
		reach common ancestor => save diff for each comment till reach branch1 => change current branch to branch2 => apply all those diff to get new commit (branch1') => delete branch1
			usually after rebase fast forward merge;
		History is lost as branch is deleted;

	Server Protocol for Remote	
		Local Protocol
		https 
		ssh 
		git
