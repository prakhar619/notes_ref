OOPs Principles are:
    1. Encapsulation            (combination of data and actions)
    2. Composition              (what obj is made of)
    3. Aggregation              (how 2 obj can interact)
    4. Inheritance              (reuse of base class)
    5. Abstraction              (capturing core ideas and ignoring specifics)
    6. Polymorphism             (allowing derived class to override action)

Terms
Assembly
Type

Access Modifiers:
    1. private                  (implicit for member)(accessible for same class only)
    2. internal                 (implicit for class)(accessible within the assembly only)
    3. protected                
    4. public                   
    5. internal protected
    6. private protected

MEMORY MANAGEMENT
 Stack
    Faster (L1 or L2 cache)
    Limited
    value type
Heap
    Unlimited
    ref type

Compare (=) is done with stack memory only


Value vs Ref type
Value type : 
    Stack  
    Cannot be NULL (except if Nullable<T>)

Ref Type :
    Heap
    Can be NULL  (except if blocked in project setting)
