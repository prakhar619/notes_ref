OOPs Principles are:
    1. Encapsulation            (combination of data and actions)
    2. Composition              (what obj is made of)
    3. Aggregation              (how 2 obj can interact)
    4. Inheritance              (reuse of base class)
    5. Abstraction              (capturing core ideas and ignoring specifics)
    6. Polymorphism             (allowing derived class to override action)
